Description

The Task Board is a project management tool designed to help project team members organize tasks, manage their progress, and track overall project status. Tasks are displayed in columns representing their progress states, allowing for easy visual tracking. Additionally, tasks are color-coded based on their proximity to deadlines, with persistent task data stored locally on the user’s device.
